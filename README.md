üì∞ Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
This project uses a Machine Learning model to detect whether a news article is real or fake.

üîç What‚Äôs in the Project?
A trained machine learning model (model.pkl)

A text vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl) to convert input text into numerical features

A Jupyter notebook (fake_news_detection.ipynb) with all the code for:

Loading and preparing data

Training the model

Evaluating and testing predictions

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably 3.8 or above).

1. Clone the Repository

Edit
git clone https://github.com/Jyothi0407-ux/Fake-News-Detection.git
cd Fake-News-Detection
2. Install Required Libraries
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Then open fake_news_detection.ipynb and run all cells to train and test the model.
